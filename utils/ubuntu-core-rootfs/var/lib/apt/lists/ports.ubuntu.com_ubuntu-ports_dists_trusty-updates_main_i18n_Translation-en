 o  The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

 rasterize fonts.

 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

Description-en: Boost.Python Library development files
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 This package also contains the pyste Boost.Python code generator that
 allows the user to specify classes and functions to be exported using
 a simple interface file, which following the Boost.Python's
 philosophy, is simple Python code.
 .
 This package allows development of a Python interface for all current
 versions of Python in Debian.  Code using this library will need also
 one of the Python development packages.

Description-md5: 1fd3f0310a5498412ebe02c4766ff0b1
Description-en: Boost.Python Library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 One of the python interpreter packages is required to use the
 created extensions.

Package: libboost-regex1.54-dev
Description-md5: 798250c772fac56d605e432dcc6fe14f
Description-en: regular expression library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description-en: serialization library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection,
 containing the following functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

 errors from sources other than the operating system, including
 user-defined sources, each error_code and error_condition has an
 associated error_category.

 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.

 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Package: python-swift
Description-md5: de070055ceecd087c69ec8d278884c43
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - account server
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.

Description-en: Detect and install additional Ubuntu driver packages
 This package aggregates and abstracts Ubuntu specific logic and knowledge
 about third-party driver packages. It provides:
 .
  - a Python API for detecting driver packages for a particular piece of
    hardware or the whole system.
 .
  - an "ubuntu-drivers" command line tool to list or install driver packages
    (mostly for integration in installers).
 .
  - a PackageKit plugin for WhatProvides() for types MODALIAS and
    HARDWARE_DRIVER, to do the same queries as above through the PackageKit API
    (for using in non-distro specific GUIs). This works with aptdaemon's
    PackageKit compatibility layer (python3-aptdaemon.pkcompat) and with
    PackageKit's apt backend, but _not_ with the PackageKit aptcc backend.
 .
  - some NVidia specific support code to find the most appropriate driver
    version, as well as setting up the alternatives symlinks that the
    proprietary NVidia and FGLRX packages use.

Package: wget
Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02
Description-en: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: ff95e4399e5ec034de6998347673eb73
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .
 More information about X.Org can be found at:
 <URL:http://www.X.org>
 .
 This package is built from the X.org xserver module.
